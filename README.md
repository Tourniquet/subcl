Subcl! a command-line client for [Subsonic][sub]
==================================================
Based on [winsbe01/subcl][origin]

Subcl is a semi-interactive command-line client for [Subsonic][sub]. It relies
heavily on mpc, so much in fact, that you still have to use the mpc command for
playback controls. Subcl only feeds mpd's playlist and keeps no track of it by
itself. (Although basically it should be possible to call another command line
		client that works in a similar fashion) If the song/album/artist you enter
is unique, subcl will immediately return. If not, subcl will list all possible
matches and ask you for the correct one interactively.

Requirements
------------
- Ruby 1.8+
- mpd
- mpc

Setup
-----
.subcl file in your home directory (~/.subcl) contains:

	server <url of your subsonic server>
	username <username for subsonic>
	password <password for subsonic>

Optionally it may contain:

	max_search_results <number, maximum search results, default 20>
	notify_method <one of below, notification system to use, default auto>
		auto - autmatically detect notifcation binary (may be slower)
		growlnotify
		notify-send

Currently supported commands
----------------------------
	search: print entries to console
	sr | search-aRtist SEARCH_QUERY
	sl | search-aLbum SEARCH_QUERY
	ss | search-song SEARCH_QUERY

	play: clear play queue and immediately start playing this
	pr | play-aRtist SEARCH_QUERY
	pl | play-aLbum SEARCH_QUERY
	ps | play-song SEARCH_QUERY
	pp | play-playlist SEARCH_QUERY
	r  | play-random COUNT (default 10)

	queue-next: add this after the current song
	nr | queue-next-aRtist SEARCH_QUERY
	nl | queue-next-aLbum SEARCH_QUERY
	ns | queue-next-song SEARCH_QUERY
	np | queue-next-playlist SEARCH_QUERY

	queue-last: add this to the end of the play queue
	lr | queue-next-aRtist SEARCH_QUERY
	ll | queue-next-aLbum SEARCH_QUERY
	ls | queue-next-song SEARCH_QUERY
	lp | queue-next-playlist SEARCH_QUERY

	albumart-url [size] : Prints the url for the albumart of the currently
	playing song to stdout. Be ware that the url will contain your basic auth
	credentials in clear text.

When choosing interactively, you can choose numbers, ranges, or 'all'. Examples:

	5
	3, 5, 8-12
	all

Notification System
-------------------
By default, if you call subcl from a place where it cannot output anything to
the tty (such as a shell script or a launcher), it will try to use your
system's notification mechanism to notify you of errors. This can be configured
via the notify_method in `~/.subcl`.


Status Codes
------------
- 1: An error occured communicating with the server
- 2: Your query returned no results

Issues
------
- no support for HTTPS (does mpd even support this?)
- password is stored in plain text
- limited control over the mpd playlist, and the mpc playlist only shows URLs
	for songs it hasn't played yet (a possible fix for this might be generating
			playlists containing the ID3 tags and feeding it to mpd instead of the
			pure URLs)

Coming up
---------
- podcasts
- search-playlist command or something similar
- structure output based on terminal width
- make search command more useful
- random-songs, random-album, random-artist, random-playlist command
- wildcard play command (don't have to specify if it's a song, an album...)
	with configurable order for non-interactive mode (First, if it's a song name,
			play this song. otherwise, if it's an album...)
- passing through of non-subcl commands (play, toggle, random) to mpc, so you
	don't have to remember which executable to call
- configurable verbosity
- interactive library browser using ncurses
